  summary: Deep learning for humans.
  description: |
    Keras is an API designed for human beings, not machines. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load:
    it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it
    provides clear & actionable error messages. Keras also gives the highest priority to crafting great documentation
    and developer guides.
